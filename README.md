## 🎨 MegaPaintApp ##
MegaPaintApp is a lightweight drawing application built with Java Swing. It includes basic painting tools, dynamic canvas resizing, and support for future features like selection, copy/paste, and custom colors. Think MS Paint, but powered by your imagination and a love of code.

## ✨ Features ##
🖌️ Brush Tool – adjustable size

❌ Eraser Tool – now uses its own size (finally!)

🪄 Fill Tool – click to flood-fill an area

📏 Auto-Resizing Canvas – canvas scales with window

🔙 Undo – because mistakes happen

🎯 Line, Rectangle, Circle Tools – draw basic shapes

🖼️ Future-ready: Selection, Copy/Paste, and Color Picker coming soon

## 🚀 How to Run ##
⚙️ Using Compile&Run (Recommended)
Included in this repo is a Windows batch file named Compile&Run.bat that makes testing easy.

Open the terminal (Command Prompt)

Navigate to the folder with your .java file and the Compile&Run.bat

## Done that? Inside the Compile&Run:
Type in the remaining text for you to type in the .java file's name that I provided for you. Then, hit enter.

## (No .java extension needed)

This will compile and immediately launch your app.
